Data structure is a way to store , organize, manage data in a computer,
so that it can be used efficiently.
it helps programmers to acceess/search, insertion,deletion, modification
just like physical tools like bag,shelves,drawers.

(Q)Why are data structure important?
Different problems require different data structure for-
 1.speed(Time efficiency)
 2.space(Memory efficieny)
 3.Simplicity(Easy to implement,read,maintain)

For fast lookup -> use set,dict 
For ordered data -> use list, sorted containers
For minimum/maximum retrieval -> use heap
For relational structure -> use tree

Types of data structure:
    1.Linear Data structure(These store data in sequence): 
        Array/List, Stack ,Tuple,
        Queue(Simple,Circular,Priority, Deque(Double-Ended Queue) )
        Linked List(Singly, Doubly, Circular)
    2.Tree based Data Structure(These store data hierarchically):
        Binary Tree, Binary Serach Tree,AVL tree, Red-Black tree, Segment tree,Fenvic tree,Trie tree, Heap(Min-heap,    Max-heap)
    3.Hash-Based Data structure(use Hashing for fast access):
        Hash Map/Hash Table(dict in Python), Hash Set(set in python), Counter(use dict)
    4.Graph Based Structures(For representing networks and relationships):
         Graph(Adjacency list, Adjacency matrix)
         Weighted Graph/Unweighted Graph
         Directed /Undirected Graph
         Cyclic/Acyclic Graph
   5.Specialized Structures(Use for advanced or specific use cases.): 
         Disjoint Set/Union-Find ,Bloom Filter, Skip List, LRU Cache, Suffix Tree/Array
         B-Tree/B+Tree (uses in databases),   Deque (Double-Ended Queue)
  
A Graph is a pair G=(V,E) 
   where: V= set of vertices(nodes) E = set of edges(connections between nodes)

1.2Directed vs Undirected
2.Weighted vs Unweighted
3.Cyclic vs Acylic    
Graph can be represented as: (a)Adjacency List, (b)Adjacency Matrix 

(a)Adjacency List Representation:
For a Directed graph: Total list of length=[E]
For an undirected graph: Total list length = 2[E]
Space Complexity : Î˜(V+E)
Used in most graph algorithms due to memory efficiency.
